### üëã Hey, I'm Bas!

I build web apps and open source packages for clients and the developer community. During the day I work at Vormkracht10. We're building smart web apps using Laravel for a variety of clients. We also open source a lot of our work. You can find our open source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/vormkracht10). After work, I like to work on open source packages and build SaaS products, on my own or with partners.

When I'm not coding you can find me walking in nature, mountainbiking, diving, reading a book or at the gym. Occasionally I write content about developing related subjects on my [blog](https://baspa.dev).  

### Open Source Projects

These are some of the open source projects I've worked on or maintain. I'm always looking for new ideas and projects to work on, so if you have any ideas, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/baspa_dev).

### SaaS Projects 

#### üí™ Workout Planner

Looking for inspiration for training schedules but don't know where to start? I know that feeling! After my journey with a personal trainer, I wanted to create my own workout schedules, but it took me a lot of time. Time I'd rather spend on my workouts! So, I developed WorkoutPlanner, a tool to generate personalized training schedules. With WorkoutPlanner, you can easily input your goals, favorite exercises, and training frequency to receive a tailored program. It takes various factors into account for optimal results.

You can start using Workout Planner [here](https://workoutplanner.so).

#### üèãÔ∏è TrainFit 

In corporation with We Are B.V. I created an all-in-one platform for Personal Trainers. On this platform they can:

- manage their clients;
- add a variety of measurements (which are shown in graphs);
- add different types of files such as training- and food schedules;
- get insights in data;
- manage agendas and appointments and
- send messages to their clients.

This platform is currently under active development and we're running a pilot with some Personal Trainers to verify the product.
